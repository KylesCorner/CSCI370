I couldn't find the season averages for MSU so I had lots of trouble completing the assignent to
specifications.

However from the data that I collected it seems as though UM defence did a great job at stopping MSU
from scoring lots of points. There were two players, one from each team, that did exceptional.
Jaxon and Tyler to be specific. They both had high true shot percentage and took lots of shots in
the game.
